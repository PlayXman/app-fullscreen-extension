# Fullscreen browser extension
Mobile browser extension allowing to open any website in fullscreen. Useful for hiding the address bar on all the web tools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not fulfilling its purpose and won't be released. The browsers don't update their viewport for fullscreen pages/elements. This means that all the content under opened virtual keyboard is always hidden and inaccessible. The idea to run web editors and different web tools in fullscreen to improve the user experience is mute.
